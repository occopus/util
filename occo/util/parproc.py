    Extends :class:`multiprocessing.Process` with graceful exiting.

    Processes of this kind are terminated in the following manner:

        - First, SIGINT is used. The process should catch it as a
          :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt`, and handle it gracefully.

        - If the process is still running after a specified timeout,
          it is sent the SIGTERM signal. The process will probably terminate
          normally, but without executing cleanup code (``finally``, etc.)

        - If the process is still running after another timeout period, it
          is probably unable to terminate on its own. In this case, the process
          is killed with SIGKILL.
